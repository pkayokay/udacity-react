// Angular and Ember use two-way data bindings. Data is in sync (is bound) throughout the app no matter where it is updated.
// The model changes the data, then the data updates in the view (vise versa as well)


// React uses - Unidirectional Data Flow
// Data flows (and lives) from the parent component to a child component.
// Only the parent component performs the update, so if a child component makes a change to the data, then it sends that data to its parent component, where they change will occur.
